"""Split WireGuard beside the DNS.

What has to hold: a config reaches one relay, and through it only that relay
- its DNS, and the services it routes - so it is never a VPN: the relay
locks forwarding in and out of wg0 whatever ip_forward says, and refuses to
run WireGuard at all when the lock does not load. A config's keys are real
X25519 keys, made here without WireGuard or a library. Each config takes one
of the plan's devices and has an address of its own, registered beside the
addresses customers type, so the allowed list, the template, the counters and
the gate treat it the same; the two rows come and go together, and a typed
address never pushes a config out. The relay is told its configs, adds and
drops them without touching the others, and says when and from where each
connected - from which the admin's limit on addresses a day is kept. The
admin turns it on, makes, shows and deletes configs; the installer puts
wireguard-tools on relays and uninstall takes everything away.
