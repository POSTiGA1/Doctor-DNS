"""The KCP transports' drive, and the installer's checks on a tunnel-only route.

What has to hold: a tunnel on xdi, kcp or pck carries BackPack's Turbo
numbers - fast retransmit, no congestion window of its own, a 10 ms tick -
at both ends, written the same by the installer, the admin panel, the relay
and a node, and still parses as BackPack reads it: the keys inside [server]
or [client]. Error correction stays off at both ends, since it must match
and the two ends are upgraded minutes apart. Other transports get none of
it. And the installer counts the sync API as answering when it answers
through the tunnel, as the sync itself uses it, rather than failing a relay
whose direct path is closed.
