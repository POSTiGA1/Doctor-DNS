"""The main server upgraded from GitHub, then the others.

What has to hold: the panel finds the latest release and says so; the
installer is taken only when its hash is the one GitHub published for it -
or, where a release carries none, when it is the main branch's byte for byte
- and says the version it claims; an older or the same version is never
installed; the upgrade runs as a unit of its own; and when this panel is back
on the new version, the other servers are upgraded one by one, once.
