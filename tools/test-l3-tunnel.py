"""BackPack's layer-3 direct tunnel, between a relay and its exit.

What has to hold: the relay dials, as in direct, but the two machines get a
small network of their own - a /30 of 10.10.0.0/16 picked by the relay's
address, worked out the same by the installer, the admin panel, the relay's
sync, the exit's sync API and its firewall, with nothing passed between
them, so each relay of an exit has its own. The relay keeps the same five
ports on its loopback as every other tunnel, each going to the exit's own
port at the far end of that network; the exit listens, its port answering
the relay alone. The exit lets the relay in from its tunnel address -
nginx, the sync API and the port 8443 rule alike. The pairing token carries
it ("-l"), the installer asks for it, and the admin panel offers it for the
main exit only: a node's end is built by its own sync, which does not make
this kind.
